# Project Plan: "LiveWork View" - Real-Time Task, Hazard & Map-Driven Tracker

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive project plan for the development of "LiveWork View," a cross-platform Flutter application designed for real-time reporting and monitoring of work activities and hazards within oil refineries and industrial facilities. The application aims to enhance safety and operational efficiency by providing a dynamic, map-driven system for tracking tasks and hazards.




### 1.1 Project Summary

"LiveWork View" is a real-time task, hazard, and map-driven tracker. It will be developed as a fully cross-platform Flutter application, supporting Android, iOS, and Web platforms. A key feature of the application is its dynamic, uploadable map system, allowing each refinery or industrial site to utilize its own plant layout image as a visual base for tracking activities and hazards.

### 1.2 Key Use Case

The primary user of the mobile application will be a firefighting/safety officer or inspector. Their workflow involves:

*   **Reporting:** Using the mobile app to report work activities or hazards, including the ability to attach photos and label reports with specific zone information.
*   **Submission to Dashboard:** Submitting these reports to a live dashboard that is viewable by management in real-time.
*   **Task Completion:** Marking a task as "Done" once it is completed.
*   **Management Monitoring:** Management can view the live status of all reports on a web-based dashboard.
*   **Custom Site Maps:** Each refinery can upload its custom site map once, which the application then uses for zone-based tagging and visualization of reports.

### 1.3 Core Modules & Features

The application will consist of three core modules:

1.  **Mobile App (Flutter – Android, iOS):** This module will enable on-site personnel to report activities and hazards. Key features include a map upload module, a report creation form, report management functionalities (viewing, marking as done, visual status), and offline support.
2.  **Web Dashboard (Flutter Web or React + Python/Firebase backend):** This module provides management with a real-time overview of all reported activities and hazards. Features include a map viewer with overlay, a report table view with filtering and sorting, and admin options for report approval, closure, and summary exports.
3.  **Backend & Data Management:** This module will handle data storage, real-time updates, and file management. Recommended tools include Firebase Firestore for the real-time database, Firebase Storage for file and image storage, and Firebase Hosting for the web dashboard. An optional Python Flask backend can be used for custom logic or PDF generation.

Each report will contain essential information such as Zone, Task type (Work/Hazard), Description, Photo URL, Status, Timestamp, and Map ID (to support multiple sites).




### 1.4 Authentication (Optional)

The application will support an optional authentication system with simple email/password login. This system will define two primary roles:

*   **Reporter (Mobile):** Users with this role will primarily use the mobile application for reporting tasks and hazards.
